# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a basic mini-game project which is very popular and simple by itself. It is a two-player game and played on a box with n x n squares. In this project, there are 3 x 3 squares. Each player is assigned a particular symbol. In this game, one player is assigned with the 'X' symbol and the other with 'O' that are common symbols. Any player can win the game by filling three rows with their symbols- horizontally, vertically or diagonally - on a 3 x 3 grid. Draw occurs if the box is filled and neither of the players was able to win.
